The old Victorian-Gothic Main Building served as the central point of the campus' forty-acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes beginning in 1882. However, by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. All that remains of the Old Main Building are its old carillon bells (called the \"Burleson Bells\"), which are now exhibited as part of a permanent display outside the university's Bass Concert Hall. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place. Originally, the University planned to use the tower as a library space, using a dumbwaiter system to carry books from the upper floors to the students requesting them on the ground floor.",

Parking was to be accommodated in three underground and six above ground levels with a total of between 800 and 1150 spaces depending if stacking is used. The project was canceled due to Issa's financial troubles in Manchester and Buffalo. Issa also purchased the Statler Hotel, located across the street, and aimed to invest $100 million in renovating that building to return it to its former glory. The building was placed into involuntary bankruptcy in 2009 and sold at auction to private investors.

The announcement of the latter building was made in the Jemison Magazine in a January 1911 article titled \"Birmingham to Have the Heaviest Corner in the South\". Over the years, that claim was inflated to the improbable \"Heaviest Corner on Earth\", which remains a popular name for the grouping.

Wallace which formed the basis of a $25 million bond issue in 1958. The plan was unusual for its time in not pursuing a \"clean-slate\" site, but rather incorporating existing structures. The 33 acres (13 ha) site includes three public plazas designed by RTKL, connected by walkways and pedestrian bridges. The plazas cover underground parking. In the late 1970s Rouse's Inner Harbor project extended the redevelopment southward to Baltimore Harbor.

Including the extra 6 years which were 1976-1982 before the Georgia Pacific tower opened. It has a stair-like design that staggers down to the ground, and is clad in pinkish granite. The tower is on the former site of the Loew's Grand Theatre, where the premiere for the 1939 film Gone with the Wind was held. (133 Peachtree St. NE, near intersection of Peachtree and Forsyth streets) The theatre could not be demolished because of its landmark status; when it burned down in 1978, clearing the way for the tower, some locals found the circumstances to be mysterious and perhaps more than coincidental. The architectural firm that built it was Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The tower is the world headquarters of Georgia-Pacific.",

However, the building was never the tallest structure in Boston. The steeple of the Church of the Covenant, completed in 1867, was much taller than the Ames Building. Due to church steeples having been included in building heights, the Ames Building was never the official tallest building in the city. Nevertheless, it is considered to be Boston's first skyscraper. Located at 1 Court Street and Washington Mall in downtown Boston, the Ames Building was designed by the architectural firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge in Richardsonian Romanesque and paid for by Frederick L. Ames. It is the second tallest masonry load bearing-wall structure in the world, exceeded only by the Monadnock Building in Chicago, completed that same year.

The top of the building is illuminated white at the corners, as well as other various colors depending on the holiday. In 1989, the same combination of developer (The Beitler Company) and architect envisioned the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle nearby. The 2,000 foot (610 m) and 125 story building would have been the tallest skyscraper in the world if completed, but plans were scrapped because of a sluggish real estate market. Many also view 181 West Madison as a model for future Pelli skyscrapers. In 2003, the architect's Two International Finance Centre in Hong Kong was completed. The building shares many similarities with 181 West Madison in terms of both styling and massing.",

It was built on the site of the old Greyhound bus station, after Greyhound built a new bus terminal on Superior Avenue a few blocks away from the East Ohio Building in 1948. East Ohio Gas, Cleveland's natural gas supplier, occupied the tower until its merger with Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion Resources. On the lobby level, East Ohio had a customer pay center and exhibits of the benefits of natural gas appliances. In addition, they had a meter showing how much natural gas was supplied to Cleveland. On November 22, 2006, the largely vacant building was bought by New York City-based Sovereign Partners, LLC for around $12 million.",

Designed by Carson Lundin & Shaw Architects, it is 300 feet (91 m) tall, was completed in 1958, and was the first new skyscraper built in Cleveland since the Terminal Tower complex was completed in 1930. It was also the first tall International Style building in the city and the first to use a reinforced concrete frame. The consulate general of Slovenia is located in the building. Like other modernist office towers of its time (including the Seagram Building, built in the same year), it is set back from the street by a small pedestrian plaza, which is interrupted only by a single-story restaurant at one end. The tower was initially intended to employ a steel frame, but reinforced concrete was used for the upper 12 floors because of a steel shortage. A seven-story parking garage adjoins it on the north side. The building was built at a cost of $17 million, and was first owned by Vincent Astor and the Brooks-Harvey Co. of New York.

    "description": "505 North Ervay, also known as the Reserve Loan Life Building, is a mid-rise skyscraper located in the City Center District of downtown Dallas, Texas (USA). Originally an office building, today it is part of the First Baptist Church of Dallas campus. Originally planned as an 8-story structure, construction began in 1945 on a square site at the corner of Federal Street and North Ervay Street. After a delay, developer Monroe Building Corporation revised the design and the structure was expanded to include three additional floors. The building was constructed of steel, brick and glass; the use of 5-foot-wide (1.5 m) exterior floor separations gave the building a horizontal emphasis. Upon completion in 1948, the building was sold to the Reserve Loan Life Insurance Company, which occupied the building's first four floors. The remainder of the office space was leased to various companies including insurance and advertising firms. It was also home to offices for the United States Secret Service, whose testimony served a role in the 1963 John F. Kennedy assassination's Warren Commission.",

The structure, was one of the structures that expanded Cleveland's central business district eastward in the early-1980s building boom in the city. The decision for Eaton Center started in 1978, when St. John's College, which at the time was owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland experienced a downturn in enrollment. St. John's College built a dormitory in 1964, but this did not help, the dormitory became offices for the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. In 2007, this complex was demolished for parking for the Avenue Apartments. With St. John's college merging with Ursuline College in 1978, the St. John's College building went vacant. Bishop James Hickey reading and hearing Cleveland's corporate community needing space offered the St. John's College land to any developer who would develop it into office space. This deal had one little problem, in October 1980 as papers were signed Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop James Hickey as Archbishop of Washington, DC, so Hickey's successor Bishop Anthony Pilla went with deal. The deal was this, St.",

Pei authored a master plan with extensive parks and greens subdivided by lengthy low-rise structures and a few stark high-rise buildings. The 40-story tower was to be the hub of the Pei plan.

However, unlike New York City, the air salt content in Des Moines was so low that the desired oxidation process failed. The result was the copper turned a dark brown. Recently, discussions started about removing the top layer of copper so that crews could purposely cause the oxidation process to create verdigris. However, it was decided that the current color is fine, and therefore left as is. The building consists mainly of office space which is largely occupied by its owner, Principal Financial Group.",

The building stands as the second-tallest building in Denver and Colorado, and as the 111th-tallest building in the United States. 1801 California Street was previously occupied by offices for US West, but now serves as the world headquarters of Qwest Communications. Upon its completion in 1983, the building stood as the tallest building in the city. However, it held it's distinction for less than a year, being surpassed by Republic Plaza in 1984. The building has a brown concrete façade, and has a stepped design featuring four setbacks. It is an example of late-modernist high-rise architecture. The shape of the building resembles two interlocked octagonal sections, which separate near the building's roof. The roof houses an antenna mast; with this structure included, the building reaches to a total height of 738 feet (225 m), surpassing the 717-foot (219 m) roof of Republic Plaza. Therefore, when measuring by pinnacle height, 1801 California Street remains the tallest building in Denver.",

In January 2008, the city announced that the complex was approved for construction with groundbreaking planned for September 2009, but the project was placed on hold indefinitely due to an economic recession. Expected to cost $150-million, the mixed-use development called for two 24-story towers to rise from a 12-story base which would connect to the 40-story Cadillac Tower. The upscale residential high-rise was slated to include a retail and entertainment complex. The architect was Anthony Caradonna, an associate professor with Pratt Institute School of Architecture in New York City and a principal with the AC/2 Studio firm, whose recent projects have included the Hotel Duomo in Molfetta, Italy and the Bar Solex in New York City. The Detroit Free Press reported in early October 2008 that the New York-based developers were having trouble meeting their deadline, and the Detroit Economic Growth Corp rejected a revised $40 million proposal described as a \"dressed-up parking garage\" by DEGC President George Jackson.",

Today, that other building is commonly known by the original Elektron Building name. Lincoln National Bank and Trust was chartered as The German American National Bank in 1905. During World War I, anti-German sentiment was running high and therefore on May 31, 1918, the German American National Bank became Lincoln National Bank. The choice of Lincoln as a name was fairly appealing, not only was there the thriving insurance company, also founded in 1905, down the street, but people were still excited about the Lincoln Highway, (the main street of America) that passed through Fort Wayne to be the first coast-to-coast highway in America.",

The architects were Mauran, Russell & Crowell from St. Louis. The contractors were Bellows and Marclay. Famed Fort Worth resident Amon Carter was the first guest of the new Blackstone Hotel. Seventy years later, his daughter, Ruth Carter Stevenson, would be the first guest of the restored hotel after 17 years of vacancy.

The building was to be located on a flatiron shaped corner and was originally known as Saunders' Triangle Building. Early in the construction nearby merchants complained about the shadow that such a tall structure would cast over the downtown area, but their objections were eventually pacified by thoughts of the publicity the building would bring and Police Chief Maddox's promise to watch the construction site lest strong winds bring the girders down on them. William Jenkins Worth, the man for whom the city of Fort Worth is named, is buried at the base of Manhattan's Flatiron Building, which inspired the design of the Fort Worth building. The building was designed by Fort Worth's top architectural firm Sanguinet and Staats in the renaissance revival style.",

The tower's step pyramidal cap reflects the design of the Indiana War Memorial, three blocks due north. The War Memorial, in turn, reflects the descriptions of the original Mausoleum.

At the request of Standard Federal Bank, the owners of the tower removed the historic neon 'Michigan National' sign. After 4 and a half years without a name, it was renamed Boji Tower after the Boji family, a father and son development team of Iraqi descent, who had owned the tower since 1998. The tower has been through one major expansion which occurred between 1965 and 1967, which include the addition of an 11-story annex built directly adjacent to the front of the tower.

The Ingalls building is bordered by East 4th Street and Vine Street in the Cincinnati Central Business District.

Since concrete possesses very low tensile (pulling) strength, many people from both the public and the engineering community believed that a concrete tower as tall as the plan for the Ingalls Building would collapse under wind loads or even its own weight.

The north facade's loggia is respectful of the older downtown architecture, being perfectly flush with the original Main Street storefronts. The open-air front portion of the loggia contains a large fountain. The large, curved portion towards the top of the building is actually an open-air observation deck. The outermost point of the circle has space for a few people at a time to be surrounded by glass, allowing for a spectacular view of the Ohio River and down Main Street.

A Concept Plan was published in April 1997 which identified three possible scenarios for the siting of the stadiums and the development of the riverfront.

The first phase of One Beale was a $150 million dollar, 27 story condominium and hotel standing at 313 ft (95 m) tall. The tower was to feature 168 hotel rooms and 159 condos. The tower also featured 75,000 square feet (7,000 m) of class A office space. The architectural firm working on this project was Hnedak Bobo Group, Inc. In August 2006, Gene Carlise revised his proposal to include two towers. The Northern tower is to be a 30 stories tall and 435 ft (133 m) making it the tallest building in Memphis over 100 North Main which is 430 ft (130 m) tall. The southern tower is to be 27 stories tall. Together the proposal is for approximately 250 hotel rooms, 150 condos, 70,000 sq ft (6,500 m) of Class A office space, and 70,000 sq ft (6,500 m) of retail, commercial and meeting space.",

It stands at the corner of Madison Avenue and north 3rd Street. Once called “the Queen of Memphis” and “the most complex, the most fabulous building in Memphis,” the Sterick Building featured a white stone spire topped with a green tile roof; its own bank, pharmacy, barber shop and beauty parlor; and stockbrokers' offices. The first three floors were made from granite and limestone. From the lobby, which was said to “rival[s] the beauty of a Moorish castle,” its eight high-speed elevators ferried the building's 2,000+ workers and guests to the upper floors, including the Regency Room restaurant on the top floor.",

The Hall was Milwaukee's tallest building until completion of the US Bank Center in 1973. Milwaukee City Hall was designed by architect Henry C. Koch in the German Renaissance Revival style, based on both German precedent (for example, the Hamburg Rathaus or city hall), and local examples (the Pabst Building, demolished in 1980). Due to Milwaukee's historic German immigrant population, many of the surrounding buildings mirror this design. The foundation consists of 2,584 white pine piles which were driven in to the marshy land surrounding the Milwaukee River. The upper part of the tower was rebuilt after a fire in October 1929. The bell in City Hall was named after Solomon Juneau, Milwaukee's first mayor. It was designed and crafted by the Campbells, who were early pioneers in creating diving chambers and suits near the Great Lakes area during that time.",

It was initially said to be built one foot shorter out of respect for the IDS Center; however, in 2005, it was revealed that contractors had surreptitiously added 14 inches of height to Capella, therefore making it taller than the main roof of IDS Center. In February 2005, the IDS counted a 17-foot (5.2 m) tall window washing garage built on its roof in 1979 as part of its actual height, making it 14 feet (4.3 m) taller than Capella Tower.",

Completed in 1988, it is 774 feet (235.6 m) tall. For many years, this was believed to be one foot shorter than Capella, but that structure actually had a different height (see the IDS Center article for details). Norwest Center was designed with a modernized art deco style by César Pelli, reflecting nearby structures such as the nearby Qwest Building and the Foshay Tower, which is several blocks away. It is also considered by many to be a homage to the GE Building at New York City's Rockefeller Center. Wells Fargo Center sits on the site of the old Northwestern National Bank Building, which was destroyed in a fire in 1982. Northwestern National, renamed Norwest, maintained its headquarters here. Despite Norwest's adoption of the Wells Fargo identity after acquiring the latter and moving to San Francisco in 1998, regional operations are still maintained in this building. It is brilliantly lit at night, with floodlamps pointing up from the setback rooftops to illuminate the sides of the building.",

That would have made it the tallest building in the South and the tallest building in the US outside of New York City and Chicago, surpassing Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia by 7 feet (2 m). However, in December 2008, developer Tony Giarratana announced that the project would be downsized, due to the economic recession. Giarratana stated that the number of condos would be reduced from around 600 to under 100, but the average condo size would more than double from an average of 1,500 square feet (140 m) to 3,500 sq ft (330 m). The height of the revised Signature Tower is 807 feet (246 m) and 50 stories tall. The Signature Tower is being developed by Giarratana LLC at an estimated cost of US$250 to 370 million.",

The Giannasca Group planned a $120 million renovation to convert the office tower into a 197-unit condominium tower with an entirely new facade. However, after damage due to Hurricane Katrina, the group was involved in faulty appropriations of insurance money that had been issued after the storm, causing the group to sue one another and default on the mortgage. In 2007, the building was auctioned off and purchased by Plainfield Asset Management for $583,000.

Many early skyscrapers took the Venetian bell-tower as a logical model for a modern office tower, but 14 Wall Street was the first to top it off with a temple in the sky, a seven-story stepped pyramid modeled on one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Bankers Trust, for whom the building was constructed, then adopted the pyramid as its trademark, and took as its slogan \"A Tower of Strength\". The first stage of construction, 1910–1912, was marked by the demolition of a 20-storey Gillender Building, claimed to be the first skyscraper demolished to make way for a taller skyscraper.

    "description": "1585 Broadway is the headquarters of Morgan Stanley, on the west side of Broadway, north of Duffy Square in Midtown Manhattan. Even before 1585 Broadway began to rise over Duffy Square, its developer, David S. Solomon, had signed law firm Proskauer Rose to a 20-year lease for 365,000 square feet (33,900 square meters). A notable achievement at any time, the deal was a milestone in a market where a growing number of new buildings were competing heavily for a shrinking number of tenants.

In 1915, when Joseph Knowland, a former U.S. congressman, acquired the Oakland Tribune, the newspaper was located at Eighth and Franklin streets in the old Golden West Hotel. In 1918, the Breuner Furniture Company vacated its home at Thirteenth and Franklin. Knowland envisioned the vacated showroom and an adjacent warehouse as the site of a first-class newspaper facility. He began to implement this vision with the acquisition of the Breuner's property and the move of the Tribune there. What became the six-story base of the Tribune Tower had been designed by D. Franklin Oliver and completed in 1907. (The warehouse, which became the Tribune's press room, had been built in the 1890s on the site of the old Pantages Theatre.)

A KOZ is designed to encourage development in poor and blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from almost all state and local taxes.

Notable occupants with headquarters in the building include Fortune 1000 company Nortek, Inc. and private equity firm Providence Equity Partners. Its exterior façade is done in \"granite framing green-reflective-glass side elevations\". Its location, sandwiched between the 130m Bank of America Building and 125m One Financial Center, ostensibly detracts from its height with architectural historian W Woodward calling it, \"a trifle too low for the site\". Though, in the company of the aforementioned buildings, it forms part of one of the most identifiable parts of the Providence skyline.

The building was built as the Industrial Trust Tower in 1927, and designed in the Art Deco style popular at the time. Though stepped buildings in New York City had been architects' solution for Manhattan's strict zoning regarding adequate light and air, facing no such restrictions in Providence, the New York architects, Walker & Gillette, chose to keep symmetrical stepped massing. The base and the trim at the base's top was built to match the cornice height of existing adjacent (now gone) four-story buildings. The building has remained relatively unchanged over the years with the exception of the lobby, the upper windows and several stone eagles at the top of the tower on the light beacon, which were removed decades ago after an eagle fell to the street below.",

Today, the Biltmore is the 9th-tallest building in the city. In 1954, when Providence was inundated by Hurricane Carol, much of the lobby of the Biltmore was underwater, and a plaque, eight feet up on lobby columns, commemorates the high water mark today. In 1975 the Biltmore closed and remained out of use until a group of local businesses implemented Federal tax credits to rehabilitate the building, reopening it in 1979. The Biltmore's external glass elevator which climbs all 18 floors of the hotel was added for the 1979 re-opening. The hotel was originally built with 600 rooms.",

Emerald Plaza finished construction in 1990. At the time of its construction, one architectural critic called it \"pretentious\" and \"discordant\" with the surrounding buildings, as well as writing the building \"... looks like a futuristic experiment, which is a fine thing on the drafting board but may look peculiar along staid Broadway.\" In June 2004, the building, along with the Comerica Building and Golden Eagle Plaza were sold to Triple Net Properties. As part of the deal, Emerald Plaza was sold for $100.94 million. Without any renovation, the building was sold again in November 2005 when RREEF paid $123 million.",

Conceived as an unusual combination of a large church surmounted by a hotel, construction of the building brought architectural dispute. Initially designed by Timothy L. Pflueger in the style of Gothic Revival, the investors fired his firm and hired Lewis P. Hobart, who changed little of Pflueger's design. In a resulting lawsuit, Pflueger won nearly half the damages he asked for. The building opened in 1930 as the William Taylor Hotel and Temple Methodist Episcopal Church. However, extra construction expenses had put the congregation at greater financial risk, and the church-hotel concept did not prove popular. No profit was made in six years, and the church left, losing their investment. In the late 1930s the building housed the Empire Hotel, known for its Sky Room lounge, then from World War II to the 1970s, 100 McAllister served as U.S.",

It is described as \"a highly influential prototype of the modern office building\" by the National Register of Historic Places. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright called the Wainwright Building \"the very first human expression of a tall steel office-building as Architecture.\" Aesthetically, the Wainwright Building exemplifies Sullivan's theories about the tall building, which included a tripartite (three-part) composition (base-shaft-attic), and his desire to emphasize the height of the building. He wrote: \"[The skyscraper] must be tall, every inch of it tall. The force and power of altitude must be in it the glory and pride of exaltation must be in it. It must be every inch a proud and soaring thing, rising in sheer exultation that from bottom to top it is a unit without a single dissenting line.",

It is part of a complex of buildings connected to each other, which also includes the Louisiana Superdome, the New Orleans Center mall (as of September 2009, closed since Hurricane Katrina), and the Benson Tower. The structure received heavy damage during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and has been shuttered ever since. The hotel owners, Chicago-based Strategic Hotels and Resorts Inc., along with other investors announced in early 2006 to redevelop the area around the Superdome (including the adjacent hotel) into a performance art park called the \"National Jazz Center.\" The plan, designed in concept by Pritzker Award winning architect, Thom Mayne was later abandoned. On February 20, 2009, an article by the Times-Picayune stated that the State Bond Commission approved $225 million in special low-cost bonds to help renovate the Hyatt Regency. Commission files indicate that developers would like to start construction this spring and then open the hotel in March 2011.",

Its basic design elements, a postmodern square tower with an elaborate base and crown, represented a departure for Portman from his earlier International-style work, and are said to have been inspired by Philip Johnson's wildly successful design for midtown Atlanta's One Atlantic Center. Ground broke in 1989 with great fanfare, but by completion in 1992, the bottom had fallen out of Atlanta's real estate market and the building sat largely empty, nearly forcing Portman into bankruptcy and causing him to lose control of most of his real estate holdings.",

At the time of completion in 1974, it was the tallest building in Dallas at 710 ft (220 m). In 1985, it was surpassed by Fountain Place and Bank of America Plaza, which became Dallas' tallest building by far. It was also clear that Renaissance Tower would be overtaken by Comerica Bank Tower and Chase Tower then under construction. Therefore, in order to regain some status, the building underwent a major renovation in 1986 which re-glazed the exterior of the building. In 1986, James T.

Unlike New York's early skyscrapers, which took the form of towers arising from a lower, blockier mass, such as the contemporary Singer Building (1902–1908), the Flatiron Building epitomizes the Chicago school conception: like a classical Greek column, its facade of limestone at the bottom changing to glazed terra-cotta as the floors rise) is divided into a base, shaft and capital.

The figurehead, which came from the ship Sultan, depicted the head of an Ottoman warrior. Whitman's store was called \"At the sign of the Turk's Head\". The figurehead vanished in a storm and today a granite replica of the original Turk head is found on the building's 3rd floor façade. After buying the building in 1997 for $4.",

The hotel also boasted social events, gold, sports leagues, a library, solarium, and an in-house magazine. An early resident was Louis Skidmore, founder of the architectural firm Skidmore Owings and Merrill. Senator Dick Durbin stayed at the hotel in 1969 when he traveled to Chicago to take the bar exam. In the 1940s and 1950s, the hotel housed a swanky lounge on its upper story, called the \"Tip Top Tap.\" Although the lounge closed in 1961, the sign proclaiming its existence is still displayed on the Allerton Hotel. By 1963, the room was home to a new restaurant, the Cloud Room, when Don McNeill moved his broadcast of \"Don McNeill's Breakfast Club\" to the location.",

At night, the top of the building facing east and west is flooded with light, creating a memorable presence on the Chicago skyline. The building was originally intended to have a twin at 181 N.

Its principal designers were Bruce Graham and Walter Netsch of the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architecture firm. The use of brushed stainless steel cladding reflects the corporation that commissioned the building as its headquarters, the Inland Steel Company. The placement of all structural columns on the building's perimeter—and the consolidation of elevators and other service functions in a separate tower—allowed for a highly flexible interior floor layout with no interior columns. This design is a good example of the widely held principle of the era, \"form follows function\" (Louis Sullivan). The Inland Steel Building was designated a Chicago Landmark on October 7, 1998.",

The building has a series of setbacks that is crowned by an ornamental four-sided clock along with a decorative weather spire. The Merc was the main element of a four building complex that eventually spanned a full city block. The site along Ervay Street between Main and Commerce previously housed the landmark 1889 Post Office Building which featured a prominent clock tower and gingerbread architecture. After abandonment it was the subject of rumors, plans and schemes but by 1936 had been declared a liability by local business leaders and was razed. The Mercantile National Bank tower was completed in 1942 and was the only major skyscraper constructed during World War II. The U.S. government had called for a halt of private construction to fuel supply materials for the war effort.",

It will provide connectivity to the city’s flourishing Arts District, bring cultural offerings together and serve as a central gathering space for Dallas and its visitors to enjoy. In addition to a restaurant and performance pavilion, plans for the park include jogging trails, a dog park, a children’s playground, a water sculpture, an area for games and much more. Construction is funded through a public, private partnership including $20 million in bond funds from the city of Dallas, $20 million in highway funds from the state and federal government through TxDOT and $20 million from private donations. In March, the Park was selected to receive $16.7 million in stimulus funds that are specifically for transportation enhancement construction.",

Famed Chicago-architect Daniel Burnham designed the Whitney. Appropriately for Detroit, it was originally styled with clean lines and Italian Renaissance/Neo-Renaissance elements, built with terra cotta materials. The original facade was altered in 1959. Decorative cornices were replaced with a 'modern' top. The first four stories of this building contain a large retail atrium. It was one of Detroit's first major mixed-use projects.

The hotel was known as the \"grand dame of Grand Circus Park.\" The site is now the location of a gravel parking lot next to the United Artists Theatre Building. Composer Gerald Marks' band, the Gerald Marks's Hotel Tuller Orchestra, was based at the hotel. The band made several commercially successful recordings for Columbia Records in the mid-1920s. The Hotel Tuller was originally constructed in 1906 by Lew Whiting Tuller. The hotel originally had nine floors; four additional floors were added in 1914. An Annex to the west of the original building was added by 1923, and it was a popular site for conventions and banquets. A final addition was made in 1929, bring in the room count to 800, each with a private bath. Even by the 1920s, the Tuller had a difficult time competing with other Detroit hotels, and in the 1930s, the Tuller went bankrupt and was purchased by another owner.",

The Pelli tower would be located in the new Indiana Landing area of Indianapolis (which became White River State Park). The Pelli design called for an obelisk 750 feet tall, with a diameter of 130 feet at the base and 64 feet at the peak that would \"establish the Crossroads of America\". As such, the design would have been taller than the Arch, the Washington Monument, and the Statue of Liberty, and would have cost $25 million in 1980. The design was met with little local support. Some residents feared it too closely resembled a corncob, which would further the stereotype of Indiana as wholly rural.

They were constructed between 1967 and 1972 by the College Life Insurance Company using a design by famed architect Kevin Roche. They are noted for their abstract quality of the opacity of the concrete walls which face the nearby highway and the reflectivity of the glass curtain walls that face the landscaped grounds. In the 1960s the College Life Insurance Company was rapidly expanding and sought to accommodate its growing staff while providing for anticipated expansion. It decided on a plan by Kevin Roche consisting of nine identical office towers each eleven stories tall and each containing 120,000 square feet (11,000 m). This would permit it to build towers as it needed additional office space without leaving buildings idle or underused. Only the initial three towers were constructed and take the form of pyramids. In the late 1990s the site was re-landscaped and further construction of towers appears unlikely.",

The residences each had a cost of up to $US30 million, making them some of the most expensive condominiums in New York City.

The building was built in 1924 and finished in 1925. It stands at 15 stories and was once occupied by shops, offices, and the facilities of jewelry manufacturers and wholesalers. It has been known as the \"Jeweler's Building\". Architects Weston and Ellington designed it in a Neo-Gothic style. It is made mainly with brick, granite, and is sheathed in terra cotta. The Metropolitan Building closed in 1977. It is listed by the city as a planned development for lofts. In March of 2010 the Downtown Development Authority voted to install safety scaffolding and netting on the building to prevent parts of the facade from falling off.",

In addition, The New York Times Building which opened in 2007, is exactly level with the Chrysler Building in height. The Chrysler Building is a classic example of Art Deco architecture and considered by many contemporary architects to be one of the finest buildings in New York City. In 2007, it was ranked ninth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.",

It borders East 24th Street, East 25th Street, Madison Avenue, and Park Avenue South. It replaced the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, which was designed by McKim, Mead and White and had been completed only thirteen years before. The building was designed in the 1920s by Harvey Wiley Corbett as a 100-story skyscraper that would be taller than the Empire State Building. However, due to the Stock Market Crash of 1929, the construction was halted at floor 29 in 1933. There is some speculation as to whether MetLife really intended to finish the 100-story tower, but the existing building was obviously constructed to be strong enough to support it. Currently, however, there are no known plans to \"finish\" the building. The original plans were to include a New York City Subway station. The station is now located 1 block south on 23rd Street with an entrance into the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower at One Madison Avenue. The building as it exists today was finally completed in 1950.",

Originally planned to be 625 feet (190.5 m) high, in accordance with the area's zoning laws, the building was eventually elevated to 792 feet (241 m). The construction cost was $13,500,000 and Woolworth paid all of it in cash. On completion, the Woolworth building overtook the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower as the world's tallest building; it opened on April 24, 1913.

The 12-story base of the building filled an entire blockfront, while the tower above was relatively narrow. The tower floors were squares only 65 feet (20 m) on a side. At 612 feet (187 m) above grade, the Singer Building was the tallest building in the world from its completion until the completion in 1909 of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower on Madison Avenue, again in Manhattan. In 1968, the building, considered to be functionally obsolete, was demolished in order to make way for the U.S. Steel Building (currently known as One Liberty Plaza). At the time, it was the tallest building ever to be destroyed.

The towers resemble Yamasaki's World Trade Center in their vertical black and gray lines and the use of aluminum exteriors. The towers have an unusual triangular footprint and are landmarks that are clearly seen around the Los Angeles Westside. Their prominence in the Century City skyline has been reduced in recent years with the addition of new skyscrapers that partially block their view. Nevertheless, the Century Plaza Towers remain the tallest buildings in Century City and the tallest skyscrapers in Southern California outside of downtown Los Angeles. The towers sit on top of one of the world's largest underground parking garages, with a capacity of roughly 5,000 cars. Whether they are offices, apartments or condos is not known at this time. The Towers are featured on the cover of the album Going for the One by Yes. The Towers are also featured prominently in the television series, Remington Steele.",

    "description": "Built in 1964 by Alcoa, William Zeckendorf and Welton Becket Associates, the guard gated and exclusive Century Towers was originally designed as apartments by world renowned architect I.M. Pei. Perhaps best known for the “Pyramide du Louvre,” his landmark glass pyramid addition to the Louvre Museum (Paris, France,) Pei brought his signature styling to the creation of the mid-Century towers. Perfectly positioned on Avenue of the Stars, The Century Towers have become the symbolic gateway to Century City. Originally conceived and built with materials which were considered “high- tech” for the day and age, the Towers remain a significant example of timeless contemporary architecture. The Towers were converted to condominiums in 1972 by the S. John Kreedman Corporation and since have retained a reputation as one of the superior addresses in Los Angeles’s luxury condominium market. Poised on 6 acres of land (making it the largest luxury condominium property in Los Angeles), the Towers are made up of one, two, and three bedroom single story (and few double story) residences on 28 floors, featuring spectacular views of the city, ocean, mountain, and Hillcrest Country Club golf course.",

One critic dubbed it as a \"Taj Mahal\" in reference to its Italian granite, English brick and a $300,000 aquarium. However, proponents of the project argued that it the project will revive a forgotten but historically important part of Downtown and create a new public place for a city with many communities but few communal gathering places. Officials contend that the MTA-owned headquarters will save money by bringing together over 2,000 workers scattered around town at leased quarters.",

If approved, constructed, and completed, the towers would surpass Queensland 1 as the world's tallest all residential buildings, until the completion of the Chicago Spire. The Empire World Towers were originally proposed to rise 1,200 feet (366 m) and 106 stories. In December 2007, the height of the towers was decreased to 1,022 feet (312 m). It is probable that the height decrease may have been brought on due to the concerns raised by the Federal Aviation Administration about the proposed buildings' heights.",

It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on October 6, 2008. Originally completed in 1925 as the headquarters and printing facility of The Miami News newspaper, it is an example of Mediterranean Revival style with design elements borrowed from the Giralda Tower in Seville, Spain. Its cupola on a 255 foot (78 m) tower contained a decorative beacon. The Miami News vacated the building in 1957 to move to a new state-of-the-art facility on the Miami River. As refugees from Cuba fleeing the Castro communist regime arrived in Miami in the 1960s, the federal government used the facility to process, document and provide medical and dental services for the newcomers. After the major wave of refugees ended in 1972, the government sold the building in 1974.",

Palmer, the project's developer, and general contractor Bovis Lend Lease. Construction has been suspended for about a year as the developer deals with the credit crunch and is awaiting an anchor tenant for the office portion of the project.

Over 1000 state employees who had been assigned to numerous locations now work in the building. The building is named in honor of William R. Snodgrass, a career public servant who served as Tennessee's Comptroller of the Treasury from 1955 till 1999. The tower was struck by lightning on August 31, 2003, which caused a firepump to turn on the sprinkler system. This caused flooding and extensive damage to the elevator shafts. Prior to being purchased by the state, the building was used to display messages by turning on lights in the windows on the front of the building. After being dormant for 10 years a new message - \"Peace\" was displayed on December 17, 2007.",

The building and a connected four-story building were designed by Charles Luckman and Associates. It was dedicated on May 25, 1972. Originally known as the First National Center, the name was changed to the First Interstate Tower in 1981. The current name was adopted after Wells Fargo purchased First Interstate Bancorp in 1996. Upon opening in 1972, the Wells Fargo Center dwarfed all other existing high-rise developments in downtown Portland. Public outcry over the tower's scale and the potential of new development to block views of Mount Hood led to height restrictions on all new development. The public areas went under extensive renovation in 2001 including room for more retail space. Renovations were completed in 2002 at a cost of $35 million. Focused on the lobby area, it included the addition of a display on the bank's history.",

By 1988 the Lane Bryant building was demolished. The current structure was built in 1988 by a Japanese-lead development group using a design by Raul de Armas of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Within a year of completion, the building had a 90% occupancy rate and had spurred a building boom in the Fifth Avenue area. By 1992 it was fully leased.

When it opened in 1975 for New York Telephone Company, New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger decried it as the “most disturbing” of the phone company’s new switching centers because it “overwhelms the Brooklyn Bridge towers, thrusts a residential neighborhood into shadow and sets a tone of utter banality.” The building played an important part in recovering service to the Police Department in the attacks of September 11, 2001. In September 2007 it was announced that Taconic Partners bought the building from Verizon. Verizon will lease back floors 8 through 10.

The building at 195 Broadway was constructed under the leadership of AT&T's president Theodore Newton Vail, who had taken the AT&T helm in 1907 and added the same title at Western Union in 1909 when that firm was purchased by AT&T. In 1912, Vail developed a two-phase plan for a 29-story headquarters building that would be constructed on Broadway on the block stretching from Dey Street to Fulton Street.

    "description": "20 Exchange Place is a 59 floor Art Deco building in New York City. Formerly known as the City Bank-Farmers Trust Building, it was built between 1930-1931, for the newly merged National City Bank of New York and the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, predecessor firms of Citigroup. It remained the company's headquarters until 1956 and was ultimately sold in 1979. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Cross and Cross. Although Cross and Cross described the building as having no particular architectural style, it was described at the time as being in the style then known as \"modern classic\", with minimal art deco ornamentation. Originally designed in 1929 to be the world's tallest building at 846.4 feet (258.0 m), with a pyramidal top and a budget of $9,500,000, Depression era realities resulted in a scaled back, 741-foot (226 m) tall building, New York City's fourth tallest building at the time. It remained among the top ten tallest buildings in New York until 1970. Today, as the sixth tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and 27th tallest in New York City, it is still among the most prominent buildings in the city skyline.",

Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, it is 755 ft (230 m) tall with 47 floors. It was completed in 2001 and opened in 2002, at which time it was, by some reports, the 88th tallest building in the world. The building is approximately 110 000 rentable square meters (1,200,000 sq ft). Formerly known as the Bear Stearns Building, it housed the world headquarters of the now defunct investment bank from the buildings completion until Bear's collapse and sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2008. The building has an octagonal tower that rises out of a rectangular base to a 20 m (70 ft) crown made of glass which is illuminated at night. The building's visually decorative design differs from the conventional functionalist style of neighboring office buildings, and hence has proven unpopular with some critics. New York said, \"This is a building you wouldn't want to get anywhere near at a cocktail party. Dressed nearly head to toe in dour granite, and geometrically proper, it's stiff to the point of pass-out boredom.",

In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 it moved to a building on 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use. The original building constructed for the Times was a five-story structure in the Romanesque revival style, designed by Thomas R. Jackson, that occupied the site of the Brick Presbyterian Church. The 1851 building, located across from City Hall and dwarfing that of Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, was described by the Times in 2001 as \"a declaration that the newspaper regarded itself as a powerful institution in civic life.... No politician standing on the broad steps of City Hall could fail to note the newspaper's presence.",

The destruction of Building 7 is a focus of September 11 conspiracy theories. The original 7 World Trade Center was 47 stories tall, clad in red exterior masonry, and occupied a trapezoidal footprint. An elevated walkway connected the building to the World Trade Center plaza. The building was situated above a Consolidated Edison (Con Ed) power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints. When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants. In 1988, Salomon Brothers signed a long-term lease, and became the main tenants of the building.",

Arad worked with landscape architecture firm Peter Walker and Partners on the design which calls for a forest of trees with two square pools in the center, where the Twin Towers once stood. The design is consistent with the original Daniel Libeskind master plan that called for the memorial to be 30 feet below street level (originally 70 feet) in a piazza.

    "description": "Five World Trade Center, also referred to by its street address, 130 Liberty Street, is a proposed building to be located in New York City. It will be located on Site 5 of the new World Trade Center complex, but not exactly on the main 16-acre plot of land as the other four buildings. If constructed, it will be built on the site of the former Deutsche Bank Building, following its demolition. In June 2007, it was announced that financial service JPMorgan Chase planned to develop the building as a new J.P. Morgan Investment Bank world headquarters; however, JPMorgan's March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns has put the future of the 130 Liberty Street site in question, as the company is now planning to relocate its J.P. Morgan Investment Bank headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue. Tower Five was expected to be designed for residential or mixed use in the original master plan for the complex. The building was to have a height limit of 900 feet (270 m) and up to 1,500,000 square feet (139,000 m) of space.",

Originally called One Pennsylvania Plaza when the building was first announced in 2001, the Comcast Center went through two redesigns before construction began in 2005. Designed by architect Robert A. M. Stern for Liberty Property Trust, the Comcast Center was delayed as the developers tried to get the Center designated a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone. The designation would exempt tenants from most taxes for fifteen years as a way to encourage development in disadvantaged areas. Giving the Comcast Center the designation was supported by many state and city officials who hoped to keep corporations within Philadelphia, but was strongly opposed by other building owners who felt the building would have an unfair advantage in attracting tenants. Even though the bill was not approved in the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 2004, Liberty Property Trust went forward with construction.",

Completed in 1989, the 37-story building reaches a height of 627 feet (191 m). The design, by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, is considered one of the finest reproductions of the Art Deco style and similar to the GE Building in New York City. The tower is further enhanced by the use of limestone piers and recessed tinted glass with granite spandrels. The building takes cues from the nearby landmark Tribune Tower with the use of flying buttresses. A 130-foot (40 m) broadcast tower and spire tops the skyscraper. The roof top broadcast facility as well as telecommunication operations were designed and operated by James T Chiles and Telecommunication Properties, Inc.

The structural form is based on Eliel Saarinen's unbuilt competition entry for Chicago Tribune building. The architects combined Gothic and modern styles in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Once again, the talents of Rene Paul Chambellan were employed by Hood and Howells for the ornamentation and sculptures. In 1998, the building was sold to Philip Pilevsky for $15 million. Three years afterwards, the American Radiator Building was converted into The Bryant Park Hotel with 130 rooms and a theatre in the basement.",

The beacon could be seen as far away as 150 miles (240 km) on clear nights. A smaller version of the beacon, still flashing out the name of the city remains to this day, although it spells Pittsburgh as \"P-I-T-E-T-S-B-K-R-R-H\" . As of July 27, 2009, the beacon was repaired and it again spells out Pittsburgh. The tower on the roof also served as the broadcast antenna for radio station KDKA Pittsburgh.",

Before further progress could be made, financing for the project halted amid the economic downturn. Parkway22 is no longer selling units, and the website, www.parkway22.com, is no longer functional. Per a Best Western desk clerk in April 2010, Parkway22 is no longer planned to be developed. The condos were to range from junior one-bedrooms to expansive three-bedrooms. The lofts were to have an open, unstructured feel and range from one- to two-bedrooms.

The Bourse motto was \"buy, sell, ship via Philadelphia.\" The building was one of the first steel-framed buildings to be constructed. Carlisle redstone, Pompeian buff brick and terra cotta were all used in the construction of the facade. The Philadelphia Bourse stopped functioning as a commodities exchange in the 1960s. The structure continued to serve as strictly an office building until 1979, when it was sold and renovated to include upscale retail space on floors near the street level. The upper levels of the building continue to house office space. The location has not been particularly successful as a retail destination, and all of the shops and eating places now operating at the Bourse are tourist-oriented.",

Looking to get an edge up, being the largest of the Penn Center buildings and directly across Market Street from One Liberty Place, which was rising at the time, building landlords offered rental space at $16.01 a year per square foot, a marketing ploy for the building based on its address, 1601. Today, major tenants include Arthur Andersen, KPMG and The Radian Group. The building's lobby underwent remodeling in the summer of 2006.",

Architecturally, the granite-clad towers feature setbacks on the north and south sides of the building and are topped with a pair of stone diamonds with cutout squares in the center. The towers were built as part an office-building boom Philadelphia was experiencing on West Market Street in the late 1980s. Designed by IM Pei & Partners (now called Pei Cobb Freed & Partners), the towers were developed in a joint venture between Maguire Thomas Partners and IBM. IBM also leased more than half of One Commerce Square for the company's Mid-Atlantic headquarters. Construction of the first phase, which included One Commerce Square, the plaza, and retail space, began in 1985 and was completed in 1987. The project's second phase, Two Commerce Square, did not begin until a lead tenant was secured for the building in 1990.",

The interior is arranged about a central rotunda, capped by a stained glass dome. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by Frederick J. Osterling, the building was constructed on the site of Pittsburgh's nineteenth century St. Paul's Catholic Cathedral. The Union Trust Company purchased the structure in 1923, renaming it from the Union Arcade to the Union Trust Building, as well as remodeling the first four floors. Its current owner is the Mika Realty Group and is being remodeled as a LEED-certified building.

The bank was organized by a group of men led by Condy Raguet after reading about the concept of savings banks becoming popular in Great Britain. The bank quickly began to expand by adding services and branches and moving into larger headquarters buildings. By the late 1910s PSFS had the largest number of depositors of any savings bank in the United States and was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. PSFS began programs in the 1920s that encouraged children to put money into savings accounts instead of spending it on treats and school programs, allowing children to open accounts with PSFS.",

Part of a condominium boom occurring in the city, the Murano was announced in 2005 and was developed jointly by Thomas Properties Group and P&A Associates. The building, named after Murano, Italy, was completed in 2008 at a cost of US$165 million. The blue glass and concrete, 43-story, 475 feet (145 m) skyscraper was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and Associates. Murano's condos range between 740 square feet (69 m) and 2,625 square feet (240 m) and were designed to be loft-like with each featuring a balcony. The building features ground level retail space and an adjacent parking garage. Located in the West Market Street neighborhood of Center City, a neighborhood that first saw residential development in 2002, the building struggled to fill its units during the late-2000s recession. In July 2009 the Murano's owners held a successful auction on forty of the building's units. Thomas Properties Group lowered the price for the remaining unsold units based on what the forty units went for at the auction.",

The Chicago-style, glass-and-concrete skyscraper incorporated into its design several historic 19th-century buildings that lined Walnut Street.

After lying vacant and neglected for years, the only part of York Row preserved were the rowhouses' facades. Only a back portion of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society building was demolished, the rest being incorporated as retail and office space. Developer P&A Associates first attempted to develop the site in 1995, but was delayed because of a lack of investor confidence in the project. When the Philadelphia residential market improved in the late 1990s, St. James Associates Joint Venture, a joint venture of P&A Associates and others, began construction in November 2001.",

Spreckels, and his father Claus Spreckels. The building originally stood 315 feet (96 m) tall with an ornate baroque dome and four corner cupolas when construction finished in 1898. Due to its height, the building stood as the tallest building in both San Francisco and west of the Mississippi River for many years. However, eight years later, the structure was badly burned and damaged by the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, although the building did not collapse. After the fire, The Call reopened its offices at new location, The Montgomery. Later, in 1938, Albert Roller completely refurbished Central Tower.

The three towers, to be named Harbor Village Resort I, II & III, would be spaced 300 ft (91 m) apart. The entire complex was envisioned to contain 1,600 three or four bedroom residences. If built, the three 650 foot (198 m) skyscrapers would tower significantly taller than any current structure in the neighborhood. The project was proposed in 2004 by developer John Hickey and met with a combination of \"disbelief\" and skepticism by neighbors and city planners . Hickey, however, was convicted of fraud in 2005 and sent to prison in 2007 for swindling 700 investors out of $18.5 million . The project was never built.",

It remained the tallest building on the West Coast until the Space Needle overtook it in 1962. The building is a designated Seattle landmark. In 1909, Smith planned to build a 14-story building in Seattle. His son, Burns Lyman Smith, convinced him to build instead a much taller skyscraper to steal the crown from rival city Tacoma's National Real Estate Building as the tallest west of the Mississippi. Construction began in 1910. Although Smith did not live to see it, the building was completed in 1914 to a height of 143 m (462 ft) from curbside to the top of the pyramid, with a pinnacle height of 149 m (489 feet). Its ribbon cutting was July 3, 1914. Ivar Haglund of Ivar's restaurant fame bought the tower for $1.8 million in 1976. The Samis Foundation acquired the tower in 1996.",

The Space Needle features an observation deck at 520 feet (160 m), and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 feet (152 m).

One Meridian Plaza was demolished in 1999 and the property was sold by E/R Partners to the Arden Group the next year. Development of the site by the Arden Group, which owns the adjacent Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, was delayed for years as a result of a feud with rival developer Mariner Commercial Properties. Mariner owned the property 1441 Chestnut Street, which sits south of the Residences at The Ritz-Carlton site and intends to build its own residential tower. The feud began after Arden Group's lead partner Craig Spencer blocked approval of 1441 Chestnut Street because he felt the tower's design would be detrimental to the planned Residences at The Ritz-Carlton tower. This led to several years of dispute between the developers trying to block construction of each others towers.",

It was completed in 1986 and has 34 floors. The building was designed by John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson. The building receives its name from its shape and color, which resemble a tube of lipstick. At three levels, blocks of the building recede as part of Manhattan's zoning regulation in which the building is required to recede within its spatial envelope, to increase the availability of light to street level. The result is a form that looks as though it could retract telescopically. The shape, which is unusual in comparison to surrounding buildings, uses less space at the base than a regular skyscraper of quadrilateral footprint would use.

Starkweather, it was constructed from 1883 to 1886. It replaced one of the New York World's former buildings which burned down in 1882 doing more than $400,000 in damage. The facade was constructed of brick and terracotta, which was chosen by Potter due to its fire resistance and low cost. This soon led to terracotta becoming a popular element in other New York skyscrapers. It was a revolutionary structure in that it was virtually fireproof, made possible by the iron frame and the terracotta, and was the first use of fire-protected steel frame. The old Potter Building, or the World Building, was completed in 1857 and was the New York World's first headquarters. However, fire broke out in the building around 10:00 PM on January 31, 1882 and destroyed much of the block within a few hours.",

Located just east of City Hall at the intersection of Beekman and Nassau streets in the former heart of the City’s newspaper industry, the Morse Building features an intricate façade made of deep red and black brick terra cotta that combines elements of Gothic and neo-Grec styles. The facade also incorporates elements of the “Rundbogenstil,” a German eclectic, mid-19th century style that combines Romanesque and Renaissance elements and is characterized by arcaded, round arches. The Morse Building serves as a great example of architectural technology and design techniques from the 1880's. G. Livingston Morse and Sidney E.

The building stands 516 feet tall with 38 stories, and was completed in 1958. It stands as one of the finest examples of the functionalist aesthetic and a masterpiece of corporate modernism. It was designed as the headquarters for the Canadian distillers Joseph E. Seagram's & Sons with the active interest of Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of Samuel Bronfman, Seagram's CEO. This structure, and the International Style in which it was built, had enormous influences on American architecture. One of the style's characteristic traits was to express or articulate the structure of buildings externally. It was a style that argued that the functional utility of the building’s structural elements when made visible, could supplant a formal decorative articulation; and more honestly converse with the public, than any system of applied ornamentation. A building's structural elements should be visible, Mies thought.",

The plan involved consolidating several blocks into a \"superblock\" for public housing. When that plan fell through the city hoped to entice the New York Stock Exchange to relocate to the property. However the owner of the property—the firm of Atlas McGroth—successfully sued to retain their land, claiming they were more than willing to develop the site privately.

The architectural firm who designed the building was Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the same firm who designed Chicago's Willis Tower and John Hancock Center and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Madison Plaza was designed with a \"sawtooth edge\", and incorporates six corners onto the southeast face of the building. Thus, the building has nine corner offices on most of its floors. Madison Plaza was originally proposed to have a twin tower located on the lot situated south of the tower. However, plans for a second tower were ultimately abandoned. Six years later, in 1988, the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle was proposed for construction on the same lot, adjacent to Madison Plaza. Plans called for 125-story tower that was to rise 2,000 ft (610 m). However, that plan was also eventually cancelled. The lot is now the site of a parking garage. Madison Plaza is the location of \"Dawn Shadows\", a famous black metal sculpture created by Louise Berliawsky Nevelson.",

The distinctive bay windows provide light into the building's interior spaces, and the combination of a granite facade for the lower floors and brick facade for the upper stories helps lighten the load placed on the internal steel framework. The north and south walls of tile are supported on steel cantilevers that carry the load back to the internal supporting structure. The versatility and strength of metal frame construction made the skyscraper possible, as evidenced by this structure, which reaches the then-astounding height of 16 stories in 1891. Its architect was a pioneer in the development of tall buildings.",

The building featured a central court ringed by nine floors of shops with offices above and meeting rooms for the Masons at the very top. These meeting rooms also served as theaters, which contributed to the building's obsolescence; its elevators proved inadequate for these crowds, and the building rapidly fell from favor with commercial tenants. Chicago's building height regulations, enacted in 1892, did not allow taller building until the 1920s. In 1939, the Masonic Temple was demolished, in part due to its poor internal services, but also due to the construction of the new State Street subway, which would have necessitated expensive foundation retrofitting. A two-story \"taxpayer\" was erected in its place, and the Joffrey Tower currently stands on the former site of this building.",

The building was designated as a Chicago Landmark on November 6, 2002. The property, in the Jewelers' Row Landmark District, was developed by heirs of Marshall Field, and is named after Pittsfield, Massachusetts where Marshall Field obtained his first job. The nearby Burnham Center, at the intersection of Clark Street and Washington Street, was originally named the Conway Building after Conway, Massachusetts - the birthplace of Marshall Field. Marshall Field III presented the property as a gift to the Field Museum of Natural History in honor of the museum's 50th anniversary. The museum held the property until September 1960 when the museum sold it. Designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst and White, the structure combines both art deco and Gothic detailing, while complying with a 1923 zoning ordinance which mandated skyscrapers setbacks.",

The Reliance building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970; and on January 7, 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. The building was designed by Charles B. Atwood of Daniel H. Burnham's architectural firm, with E.C. Shankland as engineer. Its basement and ground floor, designed by John Wellborn Root, were constructed in 1890, while the upper three stories of the building previously on the site remained suspended above on jackscrews. The addition of the remaining floors in 1894–1895 completed the building and marked the \"first comprehensive achievement\" of the Chicago construction method. The building's plate-glass windows are set within a tiled facade. Its steel-frame superstructure is built atop concrete caissons sunk as much as 125 feet beneath the footing.",

The Kresge Company moved out of the building in 1930 for a new headquarters at Cass Park and the old headquarters remained a prime location for medical offices. The Kales building began to lose tenants in the 70s as Downtown Detroit declined. The last tenant moved out of the building in 1986 and it sat vacant during the next decade.",

One Detroit Center was constructed from 1991 to 1993. It houses numerous other tenants, including many prominent Detroit law firms, and other banks. Some, however, have expressed concern over the building's lack of exterior lighting at night, in contrast to the easily identifiable orb of the nearby Penobscot Building.

Located on the International Riverfront, the Renaissance Center complex is owned by General Motors as its world headquarters. The central tower, called the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center, is the tallest all-hotel skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere, and features the largest rooftop restaurant, Coach Insignia. It has been the tallest building in Michigan since 1977. John Portman was the principal architect for the original design. The first phase constructed a five-building rosette, with a 73-story hotel surrounded by four 39-story office towers, all surrounded by a square-shaped, 350,000 sq ft (33,000 m) all-retail podium including a shopping center with retail shops, cafes, restaurants, brokerage firms, banks, four movie theaters, private clubs, and even a department store. This first phase officially opened in March 1977. Portman's design renewed attention to city architecture, constructing the world's tallest hotel at the time. Two additional 21-story office towers opened in 1981.",

    "description": "Tower 49 is an office skyscraper in the Midtown Manhattan district of New York City. While nowhere near as illustrious as its neighbours at Rockefeller Center it is of principal architectural note because it provides an elegant solution to the problem of an irregular building lot. In this case the lot is fronted on both 48th Street and 49th Street between 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue. The street frontages were offset by about the width of an NYC brownstone lot on both sides. To answer this design challenge, the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill came up with a simple crystalline form of two chamfer-cornered masses joined by the central service core and wrapped in blue-tinted mirror glass. There are several buildings in the city with similarly irregular lots but this one shines because it looks like a design that didn't made compromises to the lot. A typical example of the offset lot design problem in New York City is the Squibb Building which occupies a midblock site between 5th & 6th Avenues and 56th & 57th Streets. As seen in this image the 56th Street side was only able to obtain half the frontage of the 57th Street side and even at that, was offset by several metres.",

    "description": "First known as the Ivins Syndicate Building, or just the Syndicate Building, the Park Row Building is located on Park Row in the Financial District of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is also known simply as 15 Park Row. The architect was Robert Henderson Robertson, a pioneer in steel skyscraper design. One of the first structures to be called a skyscraper, the building was completed in 1899 after three years of construction. The builder was William Mills Ivins, a prominent lawyer and former judge advocate general for New York State. He headed a syndicate of investors, which most likely gave root to the building's original name. At 391 ft (119.2m) tall, it was the tallest office building in the world from 1899 until 1908, when it was surpassed by the Singer Building. In 1901, an announced building project by Aetna, to be located at 33rd Street and Broadway, would have overtaken Park Row as the tallest office building at 455 feet (139 m) high, but it was never built. The building is 29 stories tall, with 26 full floors and two, three-story cupolas. It has a frontage of 103 ft (31 m) on Park Row, 23 on Ann Street and 48 feet (15 m) on Theater Alley.",

The building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1987. Before the electrification of the New York Central Railroad in 1912-1913, the neighborhood north of Grand Central Terminal was one of open-air railway yards and tracks used by steam locomotives. The electrification and subsequent covering of the yards enabled the continuation of Park Avenue to the north and the construction of new buildings (with curious foundations). Among them was the New York Central Building. In 1929, the New York Central Railroad Company built their 34-story headquarters at 230 Park Ave., New York City, New York. In 1913, New York Central bore a concept for a visual termination point in the city.",

The building was deeded by RCA to GE before construction was completed. It backs up to the low Byzantine dome of St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue and shares the same salmon brick color. But from Lexington, the building is an insistently tall 50-floor stylized Gothic tower with its own identity, a classic Art Deco visual statement of suggested power through simplification. The base contains elaborate, generous masonry, architectural figural sculpture, and at on the corner above the main entrance, a conspicuous corner clock with the curvy GE logo and a pair of silver disembodied forearms. The crown of the building is a dynamic-looking burst of Gothic tracery, which is supposed to represent radio waves, and is lit from within at night.",

It overlooks Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. The building size is approximately 1,518,000 rentable square feet, and sits on a site approximately 100 x 442 feet (67,875 square feet). The ownership is currently Brookfield Financial Properties, L.P. One of the notable aesthetic attributes of the building is the concave vertical slope of its north and south facades, on 42nd and 43rd Street.

Floors above the 23rd floor offer a virtually unobstructed view of northern Manhattan and a complete view of Central Park. One of the notable aesthetic attributes of the building is the concave vertical slope of its north and south facades, on 57th and 58th Street. This is similar to another of Bunshaft's creations, the W. R. Grace Building, which is no coincidence, as he had used the initial, rejected façade design for the Solow Building in his design for the Grace Building. The Solow Building features some of the most expensive rents in Manhattan. The Solow Building Company occupies a permanent lease of the top floor of the skyscraper.",

It houses the headquarters of Bloomberg L.P. in the lower floors and luxury condominiums in the higher floors. It is located at 731 Lexington Avenue between East 58th and 59th streets. It was built on the site of the flagship Alexander's Department Store which was torn down in 2000. The mid-block public space at the base of the building is called Beacon Court. The building stands at 54 stories tall, reaching 806 feet (246 meters). Construction started in 2001 and was completed in 2005. It is currently the 14th tallest building in New York and the 42nd tallest in the United States. The building's zip code is 10022. Several buildings were demolished to make way for the Bloomberg Tower (the tallest being the Barclay-Garrett Building). Paul Goldberger in the Aug. 6, 2007, issue of the New Yorker magazine lauded the Bloomberg offices as: \"a newsroom truly designed for the electronic age ... a dazzling work environment tucked inside a refined but conventional skyscraper.",

It was built in 1916-18 for Irving T. Bush's Bush Terminal Company, owners of Bush Terminal in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Bush Tower's unique original purpose as commercial display space and social space, its notable design that combined narrowness, height, and Neo-Gothic architecture, and its role in the evolution of Times Square and of New York skyscrapers after the 1916 Zoning Resolution all qualify it as an exceptional structure. Under Irving T. Bush (who has no relation to the Bush political family) the Bush Terminal Co. created Bush Tower to bring buyers, manufacturers, and designers together. As such, the company promoted a \"vast centralized marketplace under one roof where complete lines of goods can be examined without loss of time.\" The tower's lowest three floors were planned for the comfort and convenience of buyers visiting New York.",

It was designed by architect Philip Johnson and partner John Burgee, and was constructed in 1984. It became immediately controversial for its ornamental top (sometimes mocked as \"Chippendale\", after the open pediments characteristic of the famous English designer's bookcases and other cabinetry), but enjoyed for its spectacular arched entranceway, measuring about seven stories in height. With these ornamental additions, the building challenged architectural modernism's demand for stark functionalism and purely efficient design. It is therefore considered by many critics to be a prime example of postmodern architecture. In October 1978, AT&T was granted permission to add 81,928 square feet (7,611.4 m), the equivalent of some four floors of space on its proposed building, in exchange for agreeing to provide open public space and a three-story communications museum.",

At 13 stories and 162 feet (49 meters) high, the building does not attempt to disguise its height, but rather accentuates it by leaving relatively undecorated mullions and pilasters. Sullivan's signature ornate floral designs decorate the base and top of the facade, and across the spandrels below the window openings. Figural sculptures of angels were added at the request of the client, over Sullivan's objections. Among other clients it houses the offices of the Andy Warhol Foundation. The Bayard-Condict Building has been a National Historic Landmark since 1976.",

Ten Museum Park contains 20,000 square feet (1,858 m²) of Class A office space, retail space on the lower floors, and residential condominium units, which occupy most of the space on the upper floors. While appearing to be a typical skyscraper with identical floorplates, the residential levels are varying. The east-facing units are interlocking lofts, providing each unit with an eastern view and either a north or south-facing view as well. Lower level west-facing units are shallow flats with large expanses of glass. Upper levels of the building contain either double-height spaces or three-floor loft arrangements. Some units feature independent soaking pools.",

In addition, the project called for the renovation of the South Ferry Terminal, including the train station so it can accommodate 100,000 people.

The building was completed on December 10, 1890. The claimed height of the building was 20 stories, comparable to 16 or 18 stories by current standards. The New York World Building was also known as the Pulitzer Building after the paper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer, who commissioned it. Pulitzer's private office was on the second level of the dome and looked down on other buildings along the street. During the 19th century, many high-rise buildings were constructed by newspaper companies along Park Row, immediately east of the old New York City Hall. This developed into a competition and a race for the tallest. Other contenders included the Tribune Building designed by Richard Morris Hunt (1876), the Potter Building (1886), the Park Row Building (1899), and two other buildings by George Post, the St.",

The building has long been famous for the 150-foot (46 m) high tower and weather star advertising the insurance company under its acronym MONY. It was the inspiration for the Tommy James & The Shondells song Mony Mony. The weather star (which no longer is tied to weather predictions although it still flashes time and temperature) had a green star featuring fair, orange star for cloudy, flashing orange for rain, flashing white for snow, rising tower lights for rising temperatures, falling tower lights for falling temperature and steady temperature. In January 2008, the MONY sign was taken down by Vornado and replaced with the address of \"1740.\" Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York built the building in 1950 for its corporate headquarters. The architect Shreve, Lamb and Harmon also designed the Empire State Building. It left the building after being acquired by AXA. Mutual Insurance had been renamed MONY Life Insurance Company in 1998.",

The mid-block building has run into considerable opposition focusing on fears that it would cast a shadow over Central Park during the winter and that its mid-block location would create traffic problems. Further the building does not have financing. The building bought air rights from the University Club of New York and St. Thomas Church. On September 9, 2009, the New York City Planning Commission said the building could be built if 200 feet were clipped off the top. The City's decision not to approve Tower Verre as proposed was greeted with disappointment and derision by several prominent architecture critics. The 1,050 foot version, was approved by the City Council on October 28, 2009 in a 44-3 vote.",

At the time of its completion in 1897 the 273 feet (83 meters) tall Gillender Building was, depending on ranking methods, the fourth or the eighth tallest structure in New York. The Gillender Building was praised as an engineering novelty, \"one of the wonders of the city\". It attracted attention for a visible disproportion of height and footprint which commanded relatively low rentable area, and was deemed economically obsolete from the start. After thirteen years of uneventful existence, in December 1909 Gillender Building was sold for a record price of $822 per square foot of land, and was demolished in April–June 1910 to make way for the 41–storey Bankers Trust tower at 14 Wall Street. The New York Times called demolition of the Gillender Building the first time when a modern skyscraper was torn down and replaced with another, larger, one.
